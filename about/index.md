SlicerCMF (Cranio Maxillo Facial) is a customized version of [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org) that packages cutting-edge image analysis for dental and craniofacial data sets. SlicerCMF is developed by [DCBIA](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/dentistry-image-computing/), a team of clinical researchers, computer scientists and engineers. SlicerCMF intends to address the following gaps between clinical choices and effective treatments: (a) a lack of quantitative imaging biomarkers of bone structure; (b) limitations in techniques to assess treatment effects and quantify degradation or repair of bone; (c) a lack of software and training for the use in dental research. 

An open-source, free comprehensive software that will allow dental researchers scientists to support patient-specific decision making and assessment of the disease progression via registration of serial images.
The [DCBIA team](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/dentistry-image-computing/Personnel) gratefully acknowledge funding for this project provided by NIH NIBIB/NIDCR R01DE024450 (Quantification of 3D bony changes in Temporomandibular Joint Osteoarthritis), as well as the [Slicer community](https://www.slicer.org/).
